echo "<h1>PHP Loops</h1>";
echo "<p>Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of addin several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.</p>";
echo "<p>Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as certain condition is true.</p>";
echo "<p>In PHP, we have the following loop types:</p>";
echo "<ul>";
echo "<li><strong>while</strong> - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true</li>";
echo "<li><strong>do...while</strong> - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified is true</li>";
echo "<li><strong>for</strong> - loops through a block of code a specified number of times</li>";
echo "<li><strong>foreach</strong> - loops through a block of code for each element in an array</li>";
echo "</ul>";
